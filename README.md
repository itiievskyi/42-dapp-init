# dapp-init (42 School Project)

This is a small Blockchain project the goal of which is to create two smart contracts.
* The first smart contract (Passport) is a program for storing data about users, something like a passport. The contract must store the user data (such as Name, Surname, age, personal hash or user id) and have the functionality to record new users. This data must be public for other contracts.
* The second smart contract (Election) is a voting program. Users who were registered in the first smart contract and only them, can take part in the voting, and after the end of voting to know who won. One user can vote only for one candidate. The contract must also contain the functionality available only to the owner of the contract, such as:
  * Adding a new candidate for voting
  * Termination of voting
  
  ### Language
  **Solidity 0.4.20** was chosen as a language for this project. 
  
  ### How to run
  You can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to upload and run the contracts online but for the full functionality I'd recommend you to Install Ethereum Wallet on you computer and use it in your own local network.
  
  ### Enjoy!
